## The setup guide

You need to have node installed on your computer. Before launching a project make sure you have yarn packages installed. To do that use brew to install yarn and then launch "yarn" command in terminal.

Use <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"> this link</a> to install node.js. <br/>
Use <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/"> this link</a> to install yarn.

To check if all packages are up to date use <pre>yarn outdated</pre> command.
To upgrade them to latest version use <pre>yarn upgrade package_name@latest</pre> or <pre>yarn upgrade --latest</pre> to update all of them to latest version.

To start a development project run <pre>yarn start</pre> or <pre>yarn start:dev</pre> This will build a development bundle with hot reload etc.

To build a production bundle run <pre>yarn start:prod</pre> This will build a production bundle which will be much smaller with all js files minified. Then you can use <b>main.js</b> file to upload it to your hosting.

Launch <pre>localhost:3000</pre> in your browser to open a project.
